          <span class="benefit-expanded">Sending ticket officers on a wild goose chase is a waste of time, gas, and manpower. With Spotwise Smart Enforcement, ticket officers know exactly how many violators are parked in each lot on their route. This allows them to ignore the lots where compliance is high and reduces the number of officers needed to cover a given area. Officers also spend less time in each lot, as they know exactly which spots contain violations.

          <span class="benefit-expanded"> Stop leaving cash on the table. With our real-time system, ticket officers hit lots only when there are significant ticketing opportunities, maximizing the potential revenue gained from each stop. Further, knowing how many cars to look for drastically reduces the possibility of missing any non-paying customers during each lot walkthrough.</span>

          <span class="benefit-expanded"> Have you ever wondered how many would-be parkers check prices in your lot, only to leave to find cheaper options elsewhere? The Spotwise Smart Enforcement system keeps track of all non-paying parkers who leave within 5 minutes of parking with a metric called Bounce Rate, so you can determine if prices need to be lowered to increase demand. Accurate turnover information also makes setting parking duration options simpler and more scientific.</span>

The high resolution feed is clear enough to see litter, suspicious loiterers, and lot attendant activities, so you can ensure your clients are getting the best possible service at all times.
