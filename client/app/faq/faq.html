      <ol class="faq-benefits-list">
        <li class="faq-benefits-list-item">Cameras monitor the parking lot. These can be installed on buildings, existing lighting structures, or specially installed poles.</li>
        <li class="faq-benefits-list-item">Images are processed and sent to our secure servers in the cloud via cell network. The system can also piggyback on existing Wi-Fi networks if available.</li>
        <li class="faq-benefits-list-item">Our proprietary algorithm analyzes the images using complicated math and computer vision principles. It keeps track of which spaces are filled and how long each parking session takes.</li>
        <li class="faq-benefits-list-item">This occupancy data is combined with information collected from the payment system. Specific spots are categorized as “open,” “paid,” “near violator,” and “violator.”</li>
        <li class="faq-benefits-list-item">Data is streamed in real-time to a mobile application accessible by ticket officers. A web dashboard also displays detailed reports and analytics.</li>
        <li class="faq-benefits-list-item">Ticket officers see which lots have the most violators and check the lots that need the most attention, maximizing revenue potential and eliminating wasted time and gas.</li>
